        <p>The restoration of the observance of <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> to November 11 not only preserves the historical significance of the date, but helps focus attention on the important purpose of <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>: A celebration to honor America&rsquo;s <b>veterans</b> for their patriotism, love of country, and willingness to serve and sacrifice for the common good.  The theme for Veterans Day <b>2024</b> is &ldquo;<b>A</b> <b>Legacy</b> <b>of</b> <b>Loyalty</b> and <b>Service</b>&rdquo;, and this year&rsquo;s winning poster was designed by Myisha Godette, a retired, disabled Army Veteran from Queens, New York. Myisha&rsquo;s design was driven by a desire to represent all who have served.  NOW, THEREFORE, I, JOSEPH R. BIDEN JR., President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 11, 2024, as <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>. I encourage all Americans to recognize the valor, courage ...  Memorial <b>Day</b> is observed the last Monday of May each year, and is meant to honor all who served and gave their lives for their country. <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b> is in November, and honors all <b>veterans</b>, both ...  <b>Veterans Day</b>, in the United States, national holiday (November 11) honoring <b>veterans</b> of the armed forces and those killed in the country&rsquo;s wars. The observance originated in 1919 on the first anniversary of the 1918 armistice that ended World War I and was known as Armistice <b>Day</b>.  Unlike <b>Memorial</b> <b>Day</b>, Veterans Day pays tribute to all American veterans&mdash;living or dead&mdash;but especially gives thanks to living veterans who served their country honorably during war or peacetime.  Unlike <b>Memorial</b> <b>Day</b>, which is an older holiday dating back to 1868 and specifically honors those who died in service, Veterans Day celebrates all U.S. military veterans, living and deceased.  Veterans Day (originally known as Armistice Day) is a federal holiday in the United States observed annually on <b>November</b> <b>11</b>, for honoring military veterans of the United States Armed Forces.  Veterans Day is always observed officially <b>on</b> <b>November</b> <b>11</b>, regardless of the day of the week on which it falls. The Veterans Day National Ceremony, like most ceremonies around the nation, is held on Veterans Day itself. </p>        <p>Market hours for veterans day. Veterans day free meals ocharleys.
